very painful .
waste of time .
the first time we stopped in this place was awesome !

the man at the reception was not helpful at all .
for example , parking is not complimentary .

why they did this on a friday night is totally beyond me .
the room should have been cleaned by _num_ knowing more people are coming .
they were rude .

however , they have other things on the menu i 'm going to try .
dont bring a dog here unless you want to kill it .
first off had a horrible experience at this location .
john brown is super sketchy and now his office wo n't answer the phone .
instead we keep getting told _num_ minutes on four different times .
dirty and noisy .
unfortunately , with no comfortable arm rest .
really you 're a pizza hut .
it started off poorly with checking in with the hostess .
she did n't know what she was saying .
do not stay here .
our burgers was ok , but the most disappointing item was the chocolate cake .
the hotel description was not the same as the actual room .
i am not going to waste another second of my time dealing with walmart .

the chicken parm and gnocchi was pretty delicious , i must say .
ordered clams as an appetizer .
, i was sent to the original store to have corrected .
not sure , but yuk .

sorry - but we wo n't be going back to this place .
i said he could give me a coupon for something off .
but once i went to pay , they did n't want to honor it .
i sent the steak back , the manager came over and apologized .
carpet is substandard .
these employees are complete morons .
i also think it 's bad form to blame your staff .
how do you f up fries ?
they said they only deliver _num_ miles out and i 'm _num_ .
ripoff !
he looked but no action .
so if you 've had enough to drink you probably wo n't mind it .
but still a good store , just had a bit of an annoying experience .
walked in and the gentleman was on the phone and yelling for a employee .
we all left still hungry because we hated our food .
do not live here !
i would never return to this place .
the walls are not very thick .

it is filled with college kids drinking cheap beer .
danielle checked me in .
i do n't feel valued anymore .

i ordered the deluxe nachos and the cheese was not even melted .
not tasty .

remember , there are two type of buffets in vegas .
they also had egg fu young , which was also yuck !
ate here on a tuesday , `` steak night '' .
first of all the `` chicken '' was heavily battered .
sadly , we left before dessert .

replaced under warranty .
this review has nothing to do with the food .
they charge _num_ dollars for chips and salsa .
mine was not cooked , it was lukewarm and the cheese was not melted .
the food was very filling but the service was not the best .
i will skip going to starbucks at thunderbird road next time .

secondly , there are absolutely no good food options .
cheap !
now the spicy almond chicken was very bland and no flavor to it .
for $ _num_ per meal at an italian restaurant i expect to be full .

seems regular customers get more priority .
we walked in to sit at the bar .
i realize it was built in _num_ but it 's old and tired .
probably the worst hotel on the strip .
walked around for _num_ minutes trying to get help .
i also did not get the extra almonds i specifically requested .
something felt odd so i returned it .
avoid this place .
( by the way , calling this place `` all suites '' is misleading .
it was a disappointment overall .
that did n't happen either cause it was just not inviting .
he did nothing to resolve the issue .
as i said the rooms are small , the windows do n't really open .
neither of us could eat it .
as a matter of fact , there was probably one stain if any .

cheese enchilada tasted like dirt .
what a disappointment .
at _num_ bucks a pop normally , i felt that it is seriously overpriced .
my goodness it was so gross .
what a disappointment .
we used to live nearby , and came here regularly for karaoke .
replacement room sink drain was not hooked up .
i have to give it low reviews because the service just absolutely sucks .
it tasted more like a bad hazelnut flavor to me .
fine for families but not for a date in my view .
it is not safe and honestly the staff really did n't care .
i would not dine here again .
somebody in the kitchen needs to know about that fish and chips dish .
they do not charge your actual receipt amount .
unprofessional , would be too nice of a comment .
they made the situation like it was our fault .
the only yummy thing was the tangy mango lassi .
when i walked in , no one was at the counter .
but this location is the worst one !
do n't think that i will stay there again .
very disappointing , they were probably very expensive too !
wish the flavor was better .

very poorly maintained terminal for a big city like vegas .
there was like _num_ people waiting for a small elevator .
what was a perfect day was ruined by horrible customer service .
_num_ small stromboli and _num_ antipasto salad please .

this was my first visit to hot dog heaven .
do not stay here if you are a woman or have women with you .
when i got there , low and behold they did n't have my tv .
keep in mind it was not that windy .
this place is horrible .
however , it was not worth it to travel that far .
not really cold but a bit cooler than it was outside .
this alone is not worth the drive .
i gave $ _num_ in tips which i never thought tips were already added .
and the reps , every single one had serious attitude .
this is where it starts going downhill , y'all .
nine months later , they still refuse to help me with other opportunities .
service was off on sunday pm .
the nurses were amazing and even they admitted they hated working there .
i was beginning to feel uncomfortable and very unhappy .
this is a review of the restaurant , not the bar area .

kinda sad it was so bad .
it took _num_ minutes to get a beer after i ordered it .
it was the worst steak and lobster i have ever had .
let me tell you that it 's not worth the trouble .
chances of me coming back here ever = zero .
the sushi rice tasted very sour like it was a few days old .
she stated there was something wrong with his teeth .
very busy and they were n't ready for the crowds .
there was nothing home made tasting about the entire meal .
could act like you want to me here .
our bill came to $ _num_ without the _num_ % tip that we include .
worst ihop i 've ever been to .
probably had over _num_ varieties of sushi to select from .
paying the _num_ % more of the room rate for resort tax is absurd .
what a shame !
do n't go here if you expect even remotely decent service .
sooo disappointing ... .
tops liquor , this guy is losing you business .
why pay for a view that you wo n't see ?
tram to and from excalibur , luxor , and mandalay bay .
$ _num_ for a corona , ill pass !
the television would cut off at will or go to snow .
rio took a report but did n't even offer to change their room .
i agree with the comments about the receptionist - rude and unhelpful .
you 've found the only slot machines in vegas that never pay .
it was so crowded and loud !
in fact none of our food was hot !
or not !
we are taking our money elsewhere .
so much for getting the room for _num_ bucks a night .
sadly , i was wrong .
the chicken was dry and the sauce tasted like pasta water .
i did mention that vegas was a crap hole did n't i ?

very poor service !
took nearly _num_ minutes to get a taxi every time .
i had the fillet trio , with three different sauces and was satisfied .
service was horrible .
waitress never came back by to check on us .
not a nice big bowl of it .
anyway , no response .
stock items on counters where food is .
there is a bit of noise from the airport but not to bad .
its cheap , convenient to the strip .
not as well done as i had asked .
that just made it look very unappetizing .
this place is a complete shit show .
how does an italian restaurant screw up spaghetti and meatballs ?
it 's a bloody late mess .
the owner never once apologize or offer a refund .
i 've stayed in better cheaper places .
it makes no sense .
i wish the experience was better than it was .
i would give them honestly for the food only _num_ and half star .
waiting for over _num_ minutes watching workers on their phones not helping anyone .
absolutely one of the _num_ worst mexican restaurants i 've been to ever .
if you want thai food hit royal thai grill or thai rama .
second of all , the check-in girl was so rude .
thankfully , tempe has an abundance of chinese food outlets ; goodbye !
take out order was wrong .
security should have been better !
* i called the front desk to ask for pick-up service for dry cleaning .
i 've had cheesesteaks in philly several times and this does not compare .
some of the staff rude .
you also have the option of chipotle , panda express , or mcdonalds .
i was wrong .
she 's rude as hell .
so we just ate the appetizers .
it hurt me ... its on my mind .
so , they refunded my security deposit to priceline ?
golden nugget used to be a standard in excellence .
he was horribly rude to me and my mom .
the comforter on one bed smelled like pee .
when we ordered they brought us cold hard bread .
this is not circus circus .
finally found a buffet worse than city buffet .
worst experience with an airline in _num_ years !
not worth it .
the food was not good and very expensive .
at that point we were starving and did n't even bother going back in .
terrible customer service .
just a bad dining experience over all .
the worst gelato i 've ever had .
i emailed and physically visited their office at least _num_ times .
this place was disgusting !
i 'm grabbing lunch with my boyfriend and we pulled up to this location .
he was n't pleasant & barely even spoke .
joked with him about having the same shirt .
i ate the chicken and steak fajitas .
_num_ ) where is the wifi ?
why would anyone even consider eating here ?

the food was mediocre at best .
bad move !
i would even prefer chuck e. cheese .
the meat had good flavor but was too dry .
i 'm done with chevy and seriously i will not touch another one .
* our waitress took forever and was not that helpful .
i paid over $ _num_ for a horrible restaurant experience .
this place gets _num_ stars instead of _num_ star because of the price .
which seems like quite a hefty price tag for literally not doing anything .
that was ridiculous .
wanting to play roulette i went to the table .
i took the polish off this morning and my nails look awful .
not my fault !
i had the chicken dinner .
it 's not a nightclub .
some shady ass people i will no longer give them business .
the steak is not good there and tough .
terrible costumer service .
never again though .
zero flavor to any of the dishes .
maybe it 's gone downhill recently .
wish i could give a negative star !
the spam musubi was no better because it was probably sitting out too long .
not too impressed at all !
it was just way too sweet and lacking flavor .
girl that answer apologized about it and she was sorry for him being unprofessional .
and get mad if you ca n't hear them .
it is expensive because , hey , it 's vegas .
this place is beyond awful .
for $ _num_ more i could have stayed at a four star hotel .
your business will not last until you improve your business model .
and this was a weekday afternoon , not even a weekend .
it did not charge .
the food was okay but nothing special .
by the way this is my first yelp review i 've ever done .
potato was overcooked and burnt .
but like the boulevard mall , the years have not been kind to it .
the third night the water was freezing cold and never got hot .
i will never go back there .
but there are only a few tables opened , one for each game .
disappointed .
it 's not the same pete 's fish and chips i grew up on .
do n't make the same mistake as my friends and i .
if i ever return i would go elsewhere .
wrong !
seriously ... who does n't serve food at 10:30 pm on .

poor customer service at front desk .
i was n't impressed with this place and would n't recommend it to people .
this place is horrible .
i am charged an an additional $ _num_ in bullshit fees .
shame on harrah 's .
i would n't recommend eating here now .
such a disappointing experience !
i 'm very glad i went for a second visit that day .
i would not recommend this hotel .
what i got was a cheese sprinkled with basil and that was it .
dealers : be nice or you do n't get tips .
the only thing worth mentioning was the chips and salsa .
so , a $ _num_ comp on a $ _num_ bill .
then they told him bus is full so you ca n't go .
now for the biggest problem of all .
rooms smell like a sewer and the employees are not friendly .
i seriously ate there like _num_ times .
just a weird place to be in .
update : again , just heard more stuff have been stolen from rooms .
i ordered water before the meal and the bartender never brought it .

card does n't work to open the door .
almost _num_ dollars is ridiculous for the quality of food and one actual plate .
this fast food restaurant is really disappointing .

we use to go 1-2 times a week and we have n't been back !
terrible customer service .
the food was not good .
food in the hotel is lousy .
the ribs was extremely dry .
trust me i will not email you again .
they always seem to be trying to get more money out of you .
the trainer was rude and our dog was n't trained at all !
maid service is sloppy .
bad first impression .
otherwise , go elsewhere for better clowns .
the sheets have holes in the them .
just a bad experience .
turns out , that was n't such a good idea .
spend your money elsewhere because it certainly is n't worth it here .
i totally understand that they are just avoiding people parking .
i then repeated myself for the second and then the third reservation .
they never get the food right , they do n't speak english .
the actual tripe was very soggy .
i 'm a vegas resident so i come to this restaurant often .
this won failed at all three .
literally had a plate of wasted meat left .
tried this place out .
wrong !
it is basically powdered hot chocolate made with water .
the only redeeming thing about this place was the view .
give this place _num_ star .
sadly , will not be returning .
by the time i ate it was all soggy .
disappointed there were only _num_ shrimp in the dish .
the room itself was decent , nothing special .
all the employees looked at my brothers and i in a weird way .
the food took twice as long , again ... it was n't busy yet .
she also screaming at me `` i am not an idiot '' several times .
absolutely absurd !
i have three dogs .
we only went there because we had just arrived and were starving .
that 's not chicago that 's mexico .
in fact , why would even think like that ?
also i was not offered a refill on my iced tea either .
stupid riviera .
if you 're looking for seafood , go to the salt cellar .
it was hard to relax .
the weather was perfect at least they could have their hot tub going !
im not sure i would have finished my orders .
circus circus , you need to step up your game .
the dinning options here are not acceptable .
that sucked .
papa johns is usually better than this .
disgusting and filthy dirty carpets in the guest rooms .
_num_ passes to the gym and free wi-fi for _num_ device ?
i just could n't get past how worn the room seemed .
gee i guess we should 've asked other 's first before going .
no good food to speak of .
i stayed at circus circus as a last minute trip .
i love getting pizza by the slice , but this was awful .
until then , there 's chin chin .
_num_ ) do nothing .
ok why does the gate have to be like a million miles away ?
and they even denied that it was their fault !
i am a business traveler , i run my own charity business .
our worst meal of the weekend .
oh , i 'm sorry .
this place was awful .
i was wanting to get my nails done .
with that being said , i stay far far far away from vegas .
the wait times are always ridiculous !
that plus a _num_ minute wait with reservations .
the tv did n't work .
oh that 's how we do it , the hotel manager told me .
my wife 's omelette was pretty petite and had too much cheese .
then _num_ minutes later she comes and takes our order .
no doubt that i am an italian snob .
make reservations six weeks before we arrived in vegas for the rv lot .
spaghetti and meatballs were gummy .
last sunday morning , had an issue with the toilet .
not worth it .
mt boyfriend has been sick since about an hour when we left the restaurant .
there were plenty of vegetables in it , which was good .
the conference area was n't good .
now , i would n't recommend anyone to stay here .
this place is an absolute joke .
the steaks were dry , flavorless , and small .
so we left after about _num_ minutes .
will not be returning to this establishment .
so frustrating .
nothing was special about this place .
i try both red and white , they are identical .
everyone knows how bad this hotel is so i have nothing more to say .
are you kidding me ?
soooo not coming back !
i 'm still dealing with this place as i write this .
if my wife 's not happy , i 'm not happy .
not to mention we had to explain to our son what just happened .
um , the lamp still has a pull down string to turn it on .
the bar itself feels dirty to me .
used to come here with friends for a cheap and decent meal .
a manager approached every table but ours .
no pillows .
i was n't expecting fine dining , nor was i expecting terrible mexican dishes .
three weeks go by , and no call .
never going back to apple .
bagels and coffee would have been great .
my first clue was when i was told there was no malt vinegar .
cheap .
these guys are the typical sleazy car salesmen .
i was given a price of $ _num_ to $ _num_ .
nothing we can do at the store .
parking in the garage was usually difficult .
they do n't , but i should get the expensive one .
their so called garlic has no bit of garlic flavor what so ever .
the waiting area had shirts that you could buy .
this is totally false !
for the money the room and facilities were okay .
the decor is definitely southwestern but way over the top cheesy southwestern .
i did n't feel that was very professional .
there were a few who were very far off .
but food was just ok .
the absolute worst !
omg and the bathrooms were awful .
i ca n't even handle how gross it was .
we stayed at the riviera because it was a groupon deal .
i ordered a groupon for two night with upgraded room option included .
not good .
i 've been wanting to try this place for years .
there were no other customers in there except for me .
the worst thai bbq i 've had .
the receipt for my to-go order was literally thrown at me .
there is no reason to stay here .
would n't even accommodate for a discount to come back or let us reschedule .
ridiculous wait !
i am not a fan of this airport .
received them , and in the original packaging ) .
waiting on the rest of my food is making me sleepy .
i was there about 6:30 prime dinner hours and that place was empty .
the sushi rice was overcooked and too warm .
thick chunks of cold chicken in tomato sauce !
i left everything up at the register and walked out .
no hair !
lots of rude tourist also does n't help the overall experience .
let 's just say there are many many many other much better options .
over $ _num_ to go through a stock _num_ twin 's carbs ?
warning warning !
the fruit was not fresh .
zero stars .
not a safe hotel , no regard for their clients .
i am not a person to yell but i friggin ' lost it .
worst casino management in henderson , nevada .
so very disappointed .
this yelp elite is not impressed .
they only change $ _num_ a night and have an incredible room .
the food was disappointing to say the least .
walk in and no one greets us .
the room had no coffee machine and no wifi .
will not be back .
it is so dated !
not enough of the traditional spices .
this food is not good .
`` uh , you are open , are n't you ?
another incident was four years ago and it was a nightmare in that hotel .
not happening !
the crunchy fish sandwich is usually served with cheese .
they have hundreds of reviews and _num_ stars ... not sure why .
my daughter even said my pasta was better than their attempt at cooking !
disappointing to average service .
( i blame you , husband , for feeding me mediocre food ! )
onion rings are alright , just big and the onion had chewy skin .
i walked around some more with no help in sight .
loud and smoky like most downtown casinos , except main street station next door .
my main course was grilled fish with vegetables .
well im learning the hard way how bad it is .
this place is n't closed at all .
but again she said she would not take an order from me .
for some reason , i thought the dish would be different .
i will spare you the ugly details .
we returned to our room with new keys which of course did n't work .
the hotel just sucks !
not a good sign .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
bed is bad , showers are worst , its worse than a motel _num_ .
only reservations were available .
i do n't understand why it was not delivered promptly to my room .
a building with no beds is not a hotel .
my husband seems to think it declined since they were bought out .
the ac worked but it was old and made a lot of noise .
this branch is famous for long wait times .
after being seated ... no paella .
horrible !
two drinks in a confusing fashion were delivered .
bad costumer service .
i ordered delivery , my food showed up missing items .
being a server that could perform is not easy which she totally failed .
this wait here is ridiculous .
i told the manager and she did n't really care to explain .
one of the worst dining experiences that i 've had .
it 's a huge tourist trap .
i do not recommend anyone coming here .
but i think it should be at the same level of olive garden .
the toilet water was all over the wrap that i carry my baby in .
the kitchen was very slow , the food portion sizes confusing and somewhat disappointing .
it took over _num_ min to resolve the whole issue .
corn maze was the only redeeming part of this trip .
some things ca n't be helped , i 'm not unreasonable .
greg took it to sun cities appliance to be repaired .
i tried to find them and they could not locate them .
bad bunkers greens not nearly as nice as before overall average course condition .
it was like _num_ bucks so i had high expectations .
the clientele in the casino were very creepy .
the ratio of guys to girls was at least _num_ to _num_ .
slow service , and the food certainly does n't make up for it .
horrible service .
pretty annoying actually .
ok i am probably being too extreme , but still !
when i talked to the owner alfredo be was ride aggressive and angry .
she said current wait time was an hour to an hour and a half .
lines were to long for meals .
the staff were overwhelmed and rude .
no one went above and beyond to make me and my fianc feel welcomed .
do n't think we will be back here on purpose any time soon .
another bad idea , gentlemen .
it turns out , they do change the information before printing .
so annoying .
they should remove the word service from table service as there was none .
very upset and disappointed .
but of course , i didnt say a word .
i just checked in for a work function .
my wife , who is n't a steak fan , had the chicken .
i do n't know how to put it .
very annoying when you try to get help and people ignore you .
find your way to another spa .

she was a horrible liar !
to top it off the customer service is nonexistent .
both of us were up half the night sick .
looks like it has n't been upgraded in _num_ years .

total disaster .

_num_ hours later , we walk back , during the cold snap .
i ai n't going back .
avoid at all costs .
one of the worst dining experiences .
cold !
what a terrible experience .
literally no flavor or spice in fact .
not worth the time , the price or the wait .
my sister was too cold and call the front desk our first day .
do n't waste your time .
we like to patronize locally owned restaurants , but were disappointed with our experience .
the sofa and chairs were stained .
we got stuck with a room in the old section and it was miserable .
food was bland and service was not the greatest .
instead i gave it _num_ star .
hell , i have had better italian food at the olive garden .
closest panda express to my house ( unfortunately ) .
bad customer service .
i was excited to find a dairy queen close to home .
do n't believe their `` pay in full discount '' scam .
secondly , they have no tartar sauce or malt vinegar .
gave me cold curly fries with my meal .
gross .
it is a no good place to take your car for a fix .
zero stars !
almost $ _num_ for eggs , bland potatoes and sausage links .
the waitress walked away from our table before we finished ordering .
i do n't even know what 's going on half of the time .
month ahead of time .
it is crowded and you will have to wait to look into the cases .
do n't waste your time .
i turned it on and it appeared there was a small leak .
i could n't bring myself to by another , even at half price .
i was disappointed to see that the carousel bar was out of service .
by friday , i was having the same mechanical problems as before .
even panda fried rice than this place .
so , i would never go back .
it was these experiences more than the pho that might make me return .
bottom line - the food is not worth the money .
this was the worst experience i have ever had las vegas .
this is a bad experience .
whenever i come to town i always come here , guess no more .
they would n't even give me a refund after this ordeal .
she had a bad attitude .
nothing for an average person to buy except a $ _num_ t shirt .
i live a little over a minute away .
this will be the last time i attempt to adopt from this shelter .
they did not , no communication whatsoever .
wish i would have did more research !
really , a security guard ?
tacky as hell !
everyday i need a new room key they never work .
now i think of them as sick and big loss .
hardly even talked !
if i could give it _num_ stars , i would .
my fiance had to play maintenance guy and fix it so we could sleep .
my old qt was the one on scottsdale rd just north of the _num_ .
the reason i hear is they are short on servers .
i 'd play elsewhere unless you really are on a budget .
do n't waste your time or money .
very bland taste .
would n't recommend it .
she checked me in without every really saying anything to me .
finally on sunday , justin called me .
mccarran airport shuttle is terrible !
$ _num_ to print plain white paper , black ink .
you and the management can fuck yourselves !
the ad also showed flat screen tv 's ... they were not .
only eat ribs here .
negative : nothing ever tastes right .
but apparently , he is n't paid to listen .
if you buy food there check the expiration date before buying .
after _num_ more minutes of sitting outside waiting to order , we were done .
my wedding was march _num_ .
stayed here to get a two bedroom because our college age kiddos with us .
either way they lost a customer .
we searched through her email accounts and still no receipt .
not super yummy but not gross .
the baked potato was actually pretty good and i ate all of it .
the flour tortilla was a cross between cardboard and turtle shell .
constantly late on prescriptions and long wait times during key hours of operation .
tasted like it had sat in the garbage for a day .
way to piss off & lose all your loyal customers chicago brewing co. !
i do n't feel like i am in a restaurant at all .
then she said that i should have kept my nails facing down .
very little cod filling & the breading was oily & mushy .
she was so much more accommodating than the manager dave the entire night !
not to mention it was filthy !
the check-out line is always long ( or worse ) .
they 're just overpriced burgers .
this place has gone extremely down hill since the last time we were there !
too crowded .
if you 've got kids , it 's probably ok .
wo n't be going back there again .
resort fee is ridiculous ( $ _num_ ) , you get nothing for it .
seedy areas for a shady company .
it was not hot or spicy as the menu indicated .
the hosts seemed to have no clue what they were doing .
a friend took me here once for karaoke -- apparently it goes pretty late .
if you select specific foods , it is ok .
they have continued to raise rates .
aside from the location , it 's not a bad mall to shop at .
this place gets a _num_ star out of _num_ .
this tasted like fish sauce with water .
fortunately i did n't see him cooking my food , so i was okay .
but it is not at all nice .
the yellow tail tuna sashimi was ok .
after our wedding , i noticed that one of the diamonds fell out .
it gives off that hole in the wall feel .
but an extra $ _num_ for watered down salsa mad the experience worse .
there 's a small casino with a few tables and a mediocre restaurant .
took _num_ hours and food was cold .
we felt rushed as we decided on appetizers and entrees .
very rude !
the staff made no attempt to fix this during my stay .
the menudo was great but the tortillas unfortunately were not handmade .
i ate a couple of bites , and that was all i could take .
apparently he failed to tell his staff .
i was a bit disappointed with many things .
of course , none of the cast members were there .
at several points , nobody was present for service of any sort .
the fries were soggy and bland .
the artichoke appetizer was unappealing .
this is the oldest running casino in the nation !
they r a complete joke !
there was n't the smoky flavor you 'd expect .
this was bad experience from the start .
we immediately left and found another hotel to finish out our vegas stay .
would highly recommend avoiding any chipotle at this time .
home depot would n't help either .
horrible customer service .
dillard 's is utterly disgusting and trashy .
never had problems until now .
selection was horrible also .
so if you peel the layers away its really not that big .
the bagels are great but the service is very inconsistent and often very slow .
my mom and i went to get our mani and pedi done .
once they get your money , they do n't care about you anymore .
the food was an ultimate disappointment for how overpriced it is .
do n't go to this dealership .
the best of my choices was the sour cream green chicken enchilada .
i needed a quick dinner so i ate in the coffee shop .
now i 'm at home , in pain with no meds .
do n't waste your time here .
dumb !
calling at all times of the day , on every day of the week .
my steak was cook right , but there was a major lack of flavor .
became a time share owner about _num_ years ago , what a big mistake !
as your attorney , i advise you to take mr. duke 's advice .
what kind of establishment sells packaged drinks these days and has no coconut water ?
worst hotel ever .
this place goes to show you that crooks wo n't stay in business long .
i will not shop at one of my favorite stores again .
seating was prompt , the server was not .
i guess it was so bad i do n't remember it .
we were extremely disappointed .
just awful .
thanks but no thanks .
i wore flip flops at all times .
counter and checkout service here can be hit or miss .
this was my 6th or 7th visit in _num_ years .
the mushrooms were over-cooked and rubbery .
the restaurants are all grossly overpriced .
the only reason i gave it _num_ stars was because the steak was good .
the cashier would n't even look up at me .
also , she was inappropriate with her stories of her private life .
was n't as kid friendly as i originally thought .
one of the worst restaurant experiences i have had .
the only good thing about it was the pool area and the gift shop .
management really doesnt seem to care here !
mediocre food even worse service .
ugh .
well it 's almost _num_ am , so why should n't they be .
the sommelier did n't come by for _num_ minutes !
i brought my car to honda west because its still under warranty .
finally about _num_ i go wait in line again.
my mom had baja enchiladas which she loved .
and they do n't even have carne asada , its ground beef .
the worst optometrist 's office ever .
did n't wait so much time in walgreen 's before .
do n't even bother with this place .
steve 's response again was `` i do n't care . ''
if there is negative or _num_ start then this hotel needs it badly .
they simply do n't care .
horrible experience !
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
the chicken was dry .
but at this price , you 'd be better off at panda express .
to be quite honest , my experience was slightly disappointing .
i really was n't all that impressed .
waiter was slow and charged us for a drink he made wrong .
my pulled pork sandwich was soooo dry .
i figure _num_ minutes , in and out .
omg if yelp had minus stars this store would get a million minus stars .
after waiting about _num_ minutes we were seated directly inside the front door .
then , another full _num_ minutes to come back .
the bill for _num_ people came to around $ _num_ .

worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
service was bad .
absolutely no cream cheese in them at all .
service without a smile .
they called my doctor and told them i walked out on my ultrasound .
room has a nasty smell as soon as you open the door .
_num_ . )
charging $ _num_ for an extra shot in an espresso drink is plain ridiculous .
would definitely not stay here again .
tower _num_ .
it is dirty & not maintained properly ... ... .
with this inconvenience you would think they would of upgraded our room our something .
sure ... i ate ... i was hungry .
it 's just not that cool .
that 's not right .
made to feel like i was not a valued patient .
she says no and that she is the only one in the restaurant .
it was also ordered with other flowers so there was n't a shipping charge .
a short preface : i 'm a dumb ass .
the staff was friendly and the beer was cold .
worse customer service period !
can lose just as bad at other more friendly casinos .
first , i made a reservation on a third party website for _num_ rooms .
not a fan of this particular location .
did n't make a difference .
not impressed .
and what kind of an airport does n't have a mcdonald 's ?
customer service is trash there , never going again .
otherwise , they will act like they forgot and rip you off .
we were not going to let this experience ruin our day .
now the people here do n't even say hi or greet you .
bad customer service .
# _num_ on the worst chinese fast food list in the country .
when i first arrived i walk into the casino to check in .
they include tips , barely _num_ % i think .
customer service was the worst experience i have ever had at any hotel .
the food was marginal and over priced .
both encore which i stayed at and wynn are horrible .
the food is garbage , and the service is worse .
salads are $ _num_ .
with tip and no booze , for _num_ people was $ _num_ .
my salmon was too dry to eat .
a few minutes later , he returned with our food .
yes , portions are big but quality is low .
we stayed here last week because they are a pet friendly hotel .
but everything fell apart when my entree came out .
i could n't eat any of it .
but the vet i ended up with was horrible .
the whole dinner was nothing but a huge disappointment !
you put your own toppings on , which were your standard toppings .
it was not worth the price .
not for locals .
i wo n't be back .
almost _num_ $ for two scoops of ice cream in a plain cup .
the rooms were n't so bad , i find it to be rather small .
no apologies .
the food itself was mediocre and expensive .
so would n't i just be able to build a margherita pizza ?
i thought time warner was bad , but apparently not .
what a lousy way to handle paying customers !
most of the food was low quality and sort of crappy .
i will never go back there , and i told the staff why .
what a waste !
i did n't receive _num_ smile from this lady .
if you do not , they will pretend they did n't say it .
it tasted like i had made it at home myself .
i have never been treated sooo poorly or left an establishment feeling so unsatisfied !
this is the worst dr i 've been to in _num_ years .
we have multiple salesman in my family and they despise people like them .
it was piping hot , if somewhat bland .
not some place i would go to buy used items .
it seemed too soft for a meatball .
this was the worst experience ever !
unfortunately probably his last .
this place has got to be breaking alot of health codes .
the waitress returned and said that they were out of peach pie .
my experience was terrible !
old and run down .
i do not recommend this place .
i have no idea why i had to check this place out .
the facility is old and rundown .
was better off getting mcdonald 's .
place is run down .
the waiter checked and it was a _num_ - still older than we wanted .
it 's terrible .
i do not even know how to explain this place .
it is nowhere worth $ _num_ .
this place is bad news !
they put the veggie burger on wheat bread .
without going into further detail , kevin is extremely unprofessional .
the only reason the hotel is getting _num_ stars is the pool .
only one person was friendly and welcoming .
the food here is mediocre , but it is pretty cheap .
the card tables near the entrance blows the cards up sometimes .
i called corporate again , and spoke with someone that was worse than tim .
the thing that drives me crazy are the long long lines at checkout .
do n't make the mistake of living here .
very annoying .
the a/c unit was blowing stinky air so we ca n't use it .
seriously the worst place ever .
not awesome ... hey i live in chicago we know awesome filet !
do n't waste your time or hard earned money .
very poor quality service and food .
this shuttle is the worst .
wrong !
i was sitting next to a couple of guys who had no clue .
what i was also hoping was that the food would be better .
do not come here the service is horrible .
the pool was so gross and it 's freezing cold as well .
after a $ _num_ cab ride to get there , we were shut out .
`` no , we ca n't make food for you .
even the bread does n't taste like it used to .
he said they 'd remake my food , but it would take even longer .
happened again on our return flight even though we checked in early .
once i finished with my business , i went inside to return the key .
it was really a joke and we should have complained .
i tried to pull the water temperature handle tight and this did n't work .
it was horrible !
when they did , _num_ days later ... no clean sheets .
so many devil children running around literally screaming , running into me ect .
i 'm so disappointed in what is suppose to be such an upscale facility .
i 've canceled the order and walked out .
if only yelp offered negative star ratings .
and this visit was a miss .
the steak itself was nothing i would brag about .
the drinks were empty most of the time .
however , i hate it .
my ribeye steak and the rest of our party 's filets arrived .
obviously the people cooking it had no idea how to make it properly .

we were disappointed as we had planned to spend the day by the pool .
the bone in the chicken was broken in two places and grossed me out .

hardly no girls .
if there was a _num_ rating i would give it that .
some of the figures were so life like it was creepy .
not old chicks with back fat hanging from their bra 's .

nothing to write home about .
they tell me i do n't have enough points .
